Section.1
        WARNING!I am NOT responsible for ANY damage done by this
                program. I have done my best to make it BUG-FREE,
                however you can never be 100% sure. Use at your
                own risk.

Section.2.1
        ED&D requirements:
            - BBS software that supports the DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF
                  interface dropfile formats
            - 640Kb RAM, try to make as much free as possible
            - DESQView auto-detected and supported
            - Multi-Node Compatible
            - A FOSSIL driver (X00, BNU etc..)
            - Supports COM1-COM255

        All communications is done via the FOSSIL driver. Because of
        this, you can have ports re-mapped (ie. non-standard IRQs &
        Addresses) different kinds of flow control and super high
        speeds and this door will still work fine. Communications are
        more standardized and thus more stable. You communications setup
        is only limited by your FOSSIL driver's abilities.

Section.2.2
        ED&D is VERY easy to install:
            1 - Unarchive all the files into their own dir.
            2 - Make a .BAT file that moves the dropfile into the ED&D
                    directory and runs ED&D.EXE. Then it should change
                    back into the BBS's directory.
                E.G.:
                ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
                @echo off
                copy \renegade\door.sys \ed&d    <Moves the dropfile
                cd \ed&d                         <Goes to the ED&D Dir.
                ed&d                             <Runs ED&D.EXE
                copy \ed&d\door.sys \renegade    <Move the dropfile back
                cd \renegade                     <Goes back to the BBS Dir.
                ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
            3 - Make a menu option in your BBS software that creates
                a dropfile and executes the above .BAT file.

            You may further customize ED&D by using a plain ASCII
            text editor (like the DOS editor) and editing the ED&D.INI file.

Section.3
        NOTE! You can't upgrade version 0.98 & 0.99 to this version!
              This is because the database format has changed to allow
              greater values. Please reinstall the new version and run
              RESET.EXE.

        These are the steps to upgrading ED&D:
            1 - Unarchive the NEW version into a temporary directory
            2 - Delete the following files from the NEW version:
                    USER.REC INN.REC ED&D.INI
            3 - Copy/Move all the remaining files from the temporary
                directory OVER your old game.

Section.4

            ideas, etc...
