Introduction
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
[36m    ED&D is a thrilling fantasy door game, that is very easy to
    learn. You start off as a young warrior, with tremendous ambition
    in becoming the most famous warrior in the land. You start by
    choosing your profession, and race, along with other statistics,
    that will help you on your quest. You quickly find yourself
    in the midst of a town, eager for your gold. You slowly work
    up your knowledge and money bag, challenging stronger and stronger
    warriors until you get to your final foe....
    
    Your destiny is in your hands alone....

[32mBeginner's Strategy
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

[36m    You should start by buying the best weapon you can. Then go
    to the country side and battle a few enemies in the forest.
    When you are weak, use a heal potion. When you are done, take
    your money back to the bank and sell any platinum pieces you
    have won. Now spend your money on a new weapon, some
    new armor, more heal potions and a room at the inn.
    
    Continue working up your warrior as you get the hang of the
    game.
    
[32mTips n' Tricks
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
[36m        - Never quit the day on a empty stomach, the night
          alone could kill you.

        - Use your money wisely, and only buy what you need.
        
        - If you're at 2400 baud, try toggling ANSI off, this will
          speed up play a bit.

        - Try trading Platinum. Because it's value fluctuates, buy
          it when it's value is low, and sell it when it's value
          is high. You can double your money in one day like this.

[32mCalculating Hit Percentage
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
[36m        ED&D uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons battle system.
        This is calculated by takeing the attackers THAC0 (To Hit
        Armor Class 0) and subtracting the defender's AC (armor class).
        This is the number you must beat on a d20 (one 20 sided die;
        which produces a random number from 1-20).        
        
        EXAMPLE:
            Fighter's THAC0=18
            Goblin's AC=5
            
        The fighter must get 13 (18-5=13) or more on a d20.
        This is 7/20 or 35% chance to hit.
