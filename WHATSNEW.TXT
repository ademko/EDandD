New for Version 1.00 Alpha:

        - Format change for USER.REC and MONSTER.REC. Versions 0.98
                and 0.99 are NO LONGER COMPATIBLE with this version!
                The previous format couldn't hold enough GPs, XPs etc,
                so I had to change the format. Please reset your game
                by reinstalling it. (Just copy over the old version,
                and run reset)
        - Fixed the "Remote User sees garbage, local mode fine!" bug.
                This bug was caused because some BBS programs didn't
                COMPLETELY fill out the dropfile, and ED&D ended up
                opening the com port at 0 baud. If you still have remote
                user problems, please contact me!
        - Added Cindy to the Inn!
        - Started making WHATSNEW.TXT :)
        - Added more ANSis
        - Added more special encounters
        - ED&D will now time-out after 5 minutes of inactivity, regardless
                of the user's access level or time.

New for Version 1.01 Alpha:

	- Fixed a few spelling errors
	- Added more ANSIs (keep em' comin'!)
	- Limited the length of a character's name, so it doesn't screw
		up the top warriors listing.
	- Cindy now forgets her last fling during the daily maintenance
    - Replaced the door's comm port routines with my very own. The
        new routines are smaller, faster and more reliable,
        however the door now REQUIRES a FOSSIL driver.
        (see the DOCs for full specifications!)
    - The door no longer reads and uses the comm port speed taken
        from the dropfile. The door uses whatever speed is
        currently set. (ie. it doesn't change the speed)
    - Re-written clock routines (please inform me if you have
        any problems related to the clock)
    - Removed suggestions box. To send me a comment, etc. call
        Five Starr or send E-Mail.
    - Removed download ED&DANSI.ZIP from main menu. Waste of code.
        To download this file, call Five Starr.
    - Added my PGP public key

New for Version 1.02 Beta:

    - This will be the last "testing" version. The next version will
        be an official release. I don't know what will be so official
        about it though. :)
    - Fixed the Time Left display in the character sheet and battle
        screen.
    - You can now kill anybody, regardless of level in the country side.
    - Fixed a bug with the Bank and higher numbers (100,000+). It wouldn't
        trade platinum correctly and wouldn't allow you to enter numbers
        bigger than 5 digits, in some places. Also, many places wouldn't
        support purchases, etc. of greater than 32,000 or 64,000 GPs.
        All this is now fixed (I hope :) ).
    - Improved time & date displaying.
    - Changed back to the old time routines.
    - Add DORINFO1.DEF dropfile support.
    - Added Multi-Tasker support and time slicing
    - Added filesharing and locking via share (if loaded). Please inform
      me if there seems to be a 'Share Violation' or 'Access Denied'
      error that doesn't seem to go away.
